# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

# Objective
The objective of the dataset is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Importance in Today's world:
Diabetes prediction is vital today for early intervention, reduced healthcare costs, and improved quality of life. Predictive tools help identify high-risk individuals and tailor prevention strategies, making a significant impact on public health.
